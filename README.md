The website was made from a template

The Folders that begin with "Mentee" (ie "MenteeAlineGarcia", "MenteeAnjali") are their code. They were taken from my mom's google drive. These folders are linked inside the ".html" files.**

For the css folder, Ruchi only edited the "style.css" file. The rest was imported from the template or github.io. 

**The files that end with ".html" (ie AlineProject.html) are the sub-pages that contain the information about the mentee's projects, screenshots of their project, information about the mentee, etc. These files are linked to the main website ("index.html"), and are accessed when someone scrolls down to the "Student's Projects" part of the main website and clicks on the Mentee's project. 

My guesses: 
The "blogs" look like they were a part of the template (http://tavonline.net/html/penne2/html/index.html) but were not used for this website. 
- The "single-blog.html" looks like the sub-page that is opened when you click a blog from the template. 
- The "single-portfolio2.html" is the source for the sub-page that comes up when the "photography-Motorcycles" Portfolio is selected from the template
- The "single-portfolio3.html" is the source for the sub-page that comes up when the "branding-Muse Metta" portfolio is selected from the template. It does not look like it is being used in this website. 

- Under the "images" tab, there are several "blog-#.jpg". In the template, these were the images for the blogs. Moreover, all the ".jpg" and ".png" which are not under designated folders are either empty or gray screens.
