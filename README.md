The website was made from a template

The Folders that begin with "Mentee" (ie "MenteeAlineGarcia", "MenteeAnjali") are their code. They were taken from my mom's google drive. These folders are linked inside the ".html" files.**

For the css folder, Ruchi only edited the "style.css" file. The rest was imported from the template or github.io. 

**The files that end with ".html" (ie AlineProject.html) are the sub-pages that contain the information about the mentee's projects, screenshots of their project, information about the mentee, etc. These files are linked to the main website ("index.html"), and are accessed when someone scrolls down to the "Student's Projects" part of the main website and clicks on the Mentee's project.
