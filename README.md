**The files that end with ".html" (ie AlineProject.html) are the sub-pages that contain the information about the mentee's projects, screenshots of their project, information about the mentee, etc. These files are linked to the main website ("index.html"), and are accessed when someone scrolls down to the "Student's Projects" part of the main website and clicks on the Mentee's project. 

The icon-fonts, js folders were imported from the template. 

More info about blogs, images, etc. are on the Meeting(s) Summary doc because I was unsure about it.
