My mentee Siya Kamboj wanted to use her skills in html, css and javascript to develop a website. Her project was to
build a website with puzzles that would help middle schoolers to prepare for exams like the SAT. She created a website with three sections - Vocabulary, Mathematics and Science and each section has three levels of tests - Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. She worked on the vocabulary and math sections during the mentorship and will continue to work on the science section.

Her project consists of the following files:
   index.html - landing page of her website
   css - folder with css styling for all her sub pages.
	css/math_frame.css - css styling for the math section
	css/mathstyle.css - old styling for the top frame of the math section (when it had two frames on the page)
	css/science_frame.css - css styling for bottom frame of the science section
	css/sciencestyle.css - css styling for the top frame of the science section
	css/stylesheet.css - css styling for homepage (index.html)
	css/vocab_inter.css - style for the intermediate level of the vocabulary section
	css/vocabstyle.css - css styling for the top frame of the vocabulary section
   math - all files for the math section
	math/frame1.htm - top frame of the math section
	math/frame_math_advanced.htm - bottom frame of the advanced level of math section
	math/frame_math_begin.htm - bottom frame of the beginner level of math section
	math/frame_math_inter.htm - bottom frame of the intermediate level of math section
	math/jquery-3.2.1.min.js - jQuery code for the math section (this is a jquery library - we had to include it since github doesn't support it)
	math/math_begin.js - Javascript for the bottom frame of the beginner level of math section.
	mathhomepage.html - homepage of the math section (displaying the top frame and the bottom frame as the begineer level, by default)
	math/images - folder containing all images used in this section.
   vocabulary - all files for the vocabulary section
	vocabulary/frame_a.htm - top frame of the vocab section with the three levels marked
	vocabulary/frame_vocab_begin.htm - bottom frame of the vocab section with the beginner level questions
	vocabulary/frame_vocab_inter.htm - bottom frame of the vocab section with the intermediate level questions
	vocabulary/frame_vocab_advanced.htm - bottom frame of the vocab section with the advanced level questions
	vocabulary/vocabularyhomepage.html - webpage combining the top and bottom frames of the vocabulary section.
   science - all files for the science section.
	NOTE: Similar structure is followed for the science section but the questions haven't been added yet.

Other than the above files, nothing else is needed to run this website
